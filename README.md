# 🖥️ Data Structures Visualizer  
An interactive web-based tool for visualizing fundamental data structures and their operations in real-time. Built with **Vue.js** and **TypeScript**, this project helps users understand how data structures like **Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, Binary Trees, Heaps, and Graphs** work through animations and step-by-step execution.

## 🚀 Features  
✅ **Interactive Visualization** – Watch insertions, deletions, and traversals happen in real-time.  
✅ **Data Structure Support** – Includes Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, Trees, Heaps, and Graphs.  
✅ **Algorithm Execution** – Step-by-step execution of operations like BFS, DFS, Sorting, etc.  
✅ **Animation Control** – Adjust speed and step through operations.  
✅ **Vue.js + TypeScript** – Clean, modular, and maintainable codebase.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  
- **Frontend:** Vue.js (Composition API), TypeScript, Pinia  
- **Animations:** D3.js  
- **State Management:** Vue’s Composition API / Pinia  
- **Deployment:** Netlify

## 🎯 How It Works  
1. **Select a Data Structure** (e.g., Linked List, BST, Heap).  
2. **Perform Operations** (e.g., Insert, Delete, Traverse).  
3. **Watch Visual Execution** in real-time with animations.  
4. **Adjust Speed & Step Through** for better understanding.
